# SVM<sup>*python*<sup>

This is some code I wrote during graduate school for my work with [Thorsten
Joachims][tj], in order to faciliate developing
[SVM<sup>struct<sup>](svm-struct) extensions using Python, instead of having to
program a C API. This enabled for more rapid prototyping, at the cost of course
of lower runtime speed.

Please see `docs` for more information on how it works, or the project page.

Note that this repository and code has not been updated since 2007, and is now
***meant for archival purposes***. That is, it is in no way supported as an
active software artifact. Python and machine learning have, in any event,
changed quite a bit.
